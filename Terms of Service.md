# Terms of Service for SecureGuard

**Effective Date:** 08/09/2024

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to SecureGuard, a Discord bot designed to help secure your server, manage moderation, and ensure a safe community environment. By using SecureGuard, you agree to these Terms of Service ("ToS"). These ToS outline your rights, responsibilities, and the terms of using our services.

If you do not agree to these terms, please remove the bot from your server and discontinue its use.

## 2. License and Permission

When you add SecureGuard to your Discord server, you are granting the bot permission to:
- Access and manage your server’s roles, channels, and permissions.
- Collect, store, and manage moderation data including user IDs, messages (for spam control), and logs.
- Backup and restore server configuration data if you choose to enable the backup functionality.

You maintain ownership of your server data, but grant us permission to access and process it to provide the bot’s services.

## 3. User Responsibilities

You, as a server administrator or user with appropriate privileges, are responsible for:
- Configuring SecureGuard’s permissions, moderation features, and role assignments appropriately.
- Ensuring that SecureGuard complies with Discord’s Terms of Service and Guidelines within your server.
- Monitoring and controlling access to SecureGuard, including restricting access to its commands by setting appropriate roles and permissions.
  
Failure to configure and manage SecureGuard properly could lead to unintentional actions (e.g., bans, mutes) for which we are not liable.

## 4. Prohibited Usage

You are prohibited from:
- Using SecureGuard for illegal, harassing, or harmful activities.
- Attempting to exploit or manipulate SecureGuard’s functionality, including reverse engineering, decompiling, or attempting unauthorized access to its systems or data.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to SecureGuard if we detect misuse or abuse of the bot’s features.

## 5. Data Handling and Security

SecureGuard collects limited data (outlined in our Privacy Policy) for the purpose of performing security and moderation functions. We do not share this data with third parties unless required by law or necessary to operate our services (e.g., Discord API access).

We take reasonable security measures to protect the data we store, including encryption of sensitive backups. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security, and any use of SecureGuard is at your own risk.

## 6. Server Backup and Restore

SecureGuard offers an optional server backup and restore feature. When you initiate a backup, server roles, channel structures, permissions, and other server configurations are stored in a secure format. Backup files are accessible only to authorized server admins.

Please note:
- Backup functionality does not store user messages or Discord-specific account information.
- Restoration of server settings is done at your discretion and should be reviewed before being applied.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

SecureGuard is provided on an “as-is” basis without any warranties, express or implied. While we strive to ensure its functionality and security, we are not liable for any loss of data, server issues, or damages that may result from its use.

We are not responsible for any moderation decisions made by your server administrators or misuse of the bot’s functionality. 

## 8. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. It is your responsibility to review these terms periodically. Continued use of SecureGuard after changes to the ToS means you accept those changes.

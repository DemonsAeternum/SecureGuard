# Privacy Policy for SecureGuard

**Effective Date:** 08/09/2024

## 1. Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data SecureGuard collects, how we use and store that data, and your rights related to the information we gather. By using SecureGuard, you agree to the practices outlined in this policy.

## 2. Data We Collect

SecureGuard collects limited data required to provide its moderation, backup, and security services. This includes:
- **User Data**: User IDs, server IDs, and role information for moderation purposes.
- **Server Data**: Channel names, permissions, roles, and configurations for backup and restoration functions.
- **Audit Logs**: Actions performed by admins and moderators (such as bans, kicks, or mutes), stored for accountability and audit purposes.
- **Message Metadata**: In cases of spam or security checks, message metadata (e.g., frequency, sender, and content flagging) may be logged to prevent abuse.

## 3. How We Use the Data

The data collected is strictly used to:
- **Perform Moderation**: Manage bans, kicks, mutes, warnings, and other moderation actions.
- **Log Server Activity**: Record actions performed by the bot or server administrators to ensure accountability.
- **Provide Backup Services**: Store server configurations to allow server administrators to restore settings if needed.
- **Enhance Security**: Use message metadata and logs to detect spam or malicious activity within the server.

## 4. Data Storage and Retention

- **Moderation Logs**: Stored for a configurable time period (default is 30 days) and then automatically deleted unless configured otherwise by server admins.
- **Backup Data**: Stored securely in JSON format and is accessible only by the server administrator. These backups may be manually deleted by administrators at any time.
- **Security Data**: Any data collected for spam or security analysis is kept for as long as necessary to detect and prevent ongoing abuse.

## 5. Data Sharing

SecureGuard does not share your data with third parties except:
- **When Required by Law**: We may disclose information if required by law or in response to lawful requests by public authorities (e.g., to comply with a legal obligation).
- **To Operate the Service**: We may share data with Discordâ€™s API to perform the services as expected (e.g., to manage roles and permissions).

We do not sell or rent user data to third parties.

## 6. Security Measures

We take reasonable precautions to protect the data SecureGuard collects and stores. This includes:
- **Encryption**: Backup data is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Access Controls**: Only authorized server administrators can trigger backups or access logs.

However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Your Rights

As a user or server admin, you have the right to:
- **Access**: Request access to the data we collect and store.
- **Correction**: Correct any inaccurate or incomplete information.
- **Deletion**: Request the deletion of your data, including backups, moderation logs, or any other data stored by SecureGuard.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. It is your responsibility to review this policy periodically. Continued use of SecureGuard after changes to the policy means you accept those changes.
